<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>The GenAI Learning Assistant is a simple tool that allows you to ask questions and receive answers generated by the GenAI model. To use the assistant, simply type your question into the text field and click the "Ask" button. The assistant will then process your query and display the response in the output area.</p>

<h2>Capabilities</h2>

<ul>
<li>The assistant can answer questions about a wide range of topics, including science, history, literature, and mathematics.</li>
<li>The assistant can help you with your homework or research.</li>
<li>The assistant can also provide summaries of lectures or presentations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expected Query Format</h2>

<p>When asking a question, please try to be as specific as possible. The more specific your question, the better the assistant will be able to answer it. For example, instead of asking "What is the capital of France?", you could ask "What is the capital of France and when was it founded?"</p>
